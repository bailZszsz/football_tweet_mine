# football_tweet_mine
An introductory sentiment analysis project I'm currently* working on.

This is my first data science project. My aim is to attempt a sentiment analysis on Arsenal's Tweets from January-March (pre covid season suspension) and see if they are representative of the season they've had.
My plan is to use matplotlib, and create a graph to visualise my findings (i.e date of tweet against it's sentiment score).

It's been a great learning experience so far! I've also learnt a LOT about emojis and unicode (and plan to run a sentiment analysis on them too) 

After I have finished he task above, I plan on using Norwich's tweets (a team that has been relegated) in the same timeframe, to see if my sentiment analysis is accurate.

Some ongoing challenges/discoveries:
  1. Football tweets are very different to normal tweets - especially in terms of language used to express emotion (a lot of tweets had a neutral sentiment of 0, 
      despite not necessarily being so.
  
  2. I need to have a larger database of tweets - this will increase acurracy and variance in my data. Righ now I only have ~300.
